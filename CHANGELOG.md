## 🚀 Google Drive Cloud Integration (November 26, 2025)

### Summary

- **Total Files Modified:** 25+
- **New Features:** Google Drive OAuth integration, Activity API polling, protected folder monitoring, baseline management, manual refresh
- **New Components:** Google Drive policy forms, protected folder management UI, baseline reset controls

### Highlights

#### Google Drive OAuth & Connection Management
- Implemented OAuth 2.0 flow for Google Drive authentication
- Created `GoogleDriveConnection` and `GoogleDriveProtectedFolder` models in PostgreSQL
- Added connection management API endpoints (`/google-drive/connect`, `/google-drive/connections`)
- Protected folder selection UI with folder tree navigation
- Connection status tracking and token refresh handling

#### Google Drive Activity Polling
- Celery-based background polling service (`GoogleDrivePollingService`)
- Polls Google Drive Activity API every 5 minutes for protected folders
- Event normalization from Google Drive activity format to DLP event format
- Supports file operations: created, modified, deleted, moved, copied, downloaded
- Deterministic event ID generation to prevent duplicates
- Per-folder baseline timestamps (`last_seen_timestamp`) to prevent historical re-ingestion

#### Baseline Management System
- Per-folder `last_seen_timestamp` stored in PostgreSQL
- Polling only fetches events after baseline timestamp
- Baseline initialized to `datetime.utcnow()` when folder is added to policy
- API endpoints for viewing and resetting baselines (`/google-drive/connections/{id}/protected-folders`, `/google-drive/connections/{id}/baseline`)
- UI controls to reset individual folder baselines or entire connection baseline
- "Monitoring since" date display in policy forms

#### Manual Refresh & Event Display
- Manual refresh button in Events UI triggers immediate Google Drive poll
- API endpoint `/google-drive/poll` for on-demand polling
- Enhanced event display with Google Drive-specific fields:
  - `event_subtype`: file_created, file_deleted, file_modified, etc.
  - `description`: Human-readable activity description
  - `file_id`, `folder_id`, `folder_name`, `folder_path`: Google Drive metadata
  - `mime_type`: File MIME type
  - `details`: Raw Google Drive activity payload
- Event timestamps use actual Google Drive activity timestamp (not poll time)

#### Policy Integration
- Google Drive Cloud policy type in policy creation wizard
- Policy configuration includes:
  - Google Drive connection selection
  - Protected folder selection (multi-select)
  - Policy rules matching on `source`, `connection_id`, `folder_id`
- Policy sync updates protected folders when policy is created/updated
- Policy evaluation matches Google Drive events against configured rules

#### Database Schema
- Migration `caa6530e7d81_add_google_drive_tables.py`:
  - `google_drive_connections` table: OAuth tokens, user email, connection status
  - `google_drive_protected_folders` table: Folder metadata, baseline timestamps
- Foreign key relationships to `users` and `policies` tables

#### Files Changed
- `server/app/models/google_drive.py` - Database models
- `server/app/services/google_drive_oauth.py` - OAuth and connection management
- `server/app/services/google_drive_polling.py` - Activity polling service
- `server/app/services/google_drive_event_normalizer.py` - Event normalization
- `server/app/tasks/google_drive_polling_tasks.py` - Celery task wrapper
- `server/app/api/v1/google_drive.py` - API endpoints
- `server/app/api/v1/policies.py` - Policy sync integration
- `server/app/api/v1/events.py` - Event model updates for Google Drive fields
- `dashboard/src/components/policies/GoogleDriveCloudPolicyForm.tsx` - Policy form
- `dashboard/src/components/google-drive/` - OAuth and folder selection components
- `dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` - Google Drive API client functions
- `dashboard/src/pages/Events.tsx` - Manual refresh button
- `dashboard/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` - Manual refresh button (App Router)

#### Testing Results
- ✅ OAuth flow completes successfully
- ✅ Protected folders are stored and synced with policies
- ✅ Polling service fetches new activities correctly

## 🚀 Unified Policy Distribution & Cleanup (November 20, 2025)

### Summary

- **Total Files Modified:** 112
- **Lines Changed:** +1,295 insertions / -35,281 deletions
- **New Artifacts:** `.cursorrules`, `archive/`, `server/app/policies/`, `server/app/utils/policy_transformer.py`, `server/tests/test_agent_policy_transformer.py`, `dashboard/src/types/policy.ts`
- **Removed Artifacts:** Legacy YAML configs, `policy_engine` module/tests, `agents/common/*`, deprecated Windows/Linux installers, and 40+ outdated documentation files

### Highlights

#### Unified Policy Schema + API
- Added `type`, `severity`, and `config` columns to the `Policy` ORM plus Alembic migration, enabling storage of UI-native configurations.
- Introduced `transform_frontend_config_to_backend()` so create/update flows accept wizard output while preserving backend condition/action logic.
- `/api/v1/policies` responses now include the new fields, enforce real `User` objects for auth, and expose a `/policies/stats/summary` endpoint with MongoDB-backed violation counts.

#### Agent Policy Bundles
- Created `AgentPolicyTransformer` and `/api/v1/agents/{id}/policies/sync`, caching bundles per platform/capability in Redis to minimize payload churn.
- Agents register/report capability flags plus policy sync metadata (`policy_version`, `policy_sync_status`, `policy_last_synced_at`, `policy_sync_error`) so operators can verify rollout status from the dashboard.

#### Windows & Linux Agent Runtime
- Agents now fetch bundles on startup and at `policy_sync_interval`, restart filesystem observers when monitored paths change, and include policy context in file/clipboard/USB events.
- USB transfer handling maps to per-policy actions (block/quarantine/log) and emits richer telemetry (source/destination paths, policy metadata, content snippets).
- Heartbeats inherit policy version/sync metadata, while event payloads include `policy_version`, `source_path`, and truncated `content` for downstream evaluation.

#### Event Pipeline Hardening
- `EventProcessor` now plugs into the database-backed evaluator/action executor, attaches `matched_policies` and `policy_action_summaries`, and preserves clipboard text for policy checks.
- Clipboard events automatically populate `clipboard_content`, and USB/file events carry additional metadata for evaluator rules.

#### Frontend & Docs
- `dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` hydrates auth tokens from persisted state and adds helpers for enable/disable/statistics calls; shared policy types live under `dashboard/src/types/policy.ts`.
- `README.md`, `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`, and `TESTING_COMMANDS.md` reference the new policy workflow, while the obsolete documentation tree was moved into `archive/` or removed entirely to keep the repo lean.

## Summary

- **Total Files Modified:** 53 files
- **Lines Changed:** +3,869 insertions, -826 deletions
- **New Files:** 2 (.env.example, Login page component)
- **Major Fixes:** Dashboard authentication, Dashboard overview page, Alerts page, Events API, Linux Agent connectivity, Windows Agent connectivity, Docker configuration, Configuration system (removed hardcoded paths/IPs), Windows Agent USB monitoring threading fix, Agent lifecycle management, Timezone display (IST), Heartbeat system improvements, File transfer blocking (Windows), Event display improvements

## 🎯 Latest Updates (December 2025)

### 18. Policy System & Agent Alignment (early December 2025)
- Backend: tightened policy bundle generation (`agent_policy_transformer`), agent policy sync API, and action execution paths to reflect updated policy schemas; added tests for transformer and Google Drive normalization/models.
- Agents: Linux agent classification and config defaults aligned; supports faster policy sync cadence and logs richer heartbeat/sync telemetry.
- Frontend: policy forms/types updated to current backend schema (actions, fields), details modal and table rows refreshed to reflect new policy shape.
- Data: Alembic migration for Google Drive tables kept in sync; sample test files expanded for new classifiers/policies.
- Note: Quarantine remains future work (tracked in `archive/FUTURE_TODO.md`); current actions focus on alert/log/block.

### 17. Installer Automation (Windows & Linux) - December 10, 2025
- Added scripted installers:
  - **Windows:** `scripts/install_windows_agent.ps1` clones the agent, builds a venv, templates config, and registers a SYSTEM AtStartup Scheduled Task with restart-on-failure. Docs include usage, args, and troubleshooting.
  - **Linux:** `scripts/install_linux_agent.sh` clones the agent, builds a venv, templates config, and installs a systemd service (boot autostart, restart on failure).
- Docs: `scripts/README.md` updated with arguments, examples, and post-install commands.
- Hardening: Linux installer skips empty configs, handles `--force` clean re-provisioning, and notes agent log location (`/root/cybersentinel_agent.log` by default).
- Outcome: Both agents verified to auto-start after reboot; Linux logs surface 404 if manager is down (expected until registration).

### 16. India-Specific Detection & Clipboard Policy Alignment

#### Summary
- **Goal:** Align clipboard and file transfer detection with India-first identifiers and ensure agents strictly follow database policies as the single source of truth.

#### Highlights
- **India-Specific Patterns (Agents):**
  - Extended Windows agent content classifier to detect Aadhaar, PAN, IFSC, Indian bank accounts, Indian phone numbers, UPI IDs, MICR, and Indian-format dates of birth.
  - Added source code and secret patterns: generic code tokens, AWS access keys, GitHub tokens, generic API keys, and database connection strings (JDBC, MongoDB, Redis).
  - Reused the same classifier for clipboard, file events, and USB transfer events so all channels share a consistent label set.
- **Clipboard Monitoring (Windows):**
  - Switched clipboard capture to prefer `CF_UNICODETEXT` with fallback to `CF_TEXT`, fixing missing events from modern apps and standard `Ctrl+C` flows.
  - Introduced agent-side policy awareness: clipboard events are only sent when content is classified as sensitive **and** at least one active clipboard policy’s configured patterns match the detected labels.
  - Logged active clipboard/file/USB policy names on every policy bundle application to simplify debugging and manual validation.
- **Linux Agent:**
  - Confirmed filesystem monitoring pipeline and classification for sensitive content; added dedicated tests for Indian identifier and source code patterns.
  - Clarified that Linux currently performs **logical** blocking only (events marked as blocked by policies) and does not delete/move files on disk.
- **Quarantine Action Visibility:**
  - Temporarily removed `quarantine` from user-selectable actions in the dashboard (`File System` and `USB Transfer` policies) and from shared policy types.
  - Documented current limitation in `archive/FUTURE_TODO.md` – quarantine is tracked as future work and is not advertised as a working action in the UI.

#### Files Touched (Highlights)
- `agents/endpoint/windows/agent.py` – Unicode clipboard capture, India/source-code classifier, clipboard policy matching, USB transfer policy alignment.
- `agents/endpoint/linux/agent.py` – Classification confirmation and tests for new patterns.
- `dashboard/src/types/policy.ts` – Removed `quarantine` from active action enums; tightened policy types around `alert`, `log`, and `block`.
- `dashboard/src/components/policies/FileSystemPolicyForm.tsx` – Removed quarantine option and quarantine path field.
- `dashboard/src/components/policies/GoogleDriveLocalPolicyForm.tsx` – Removed quarantine option and quarantine path field.
- `dashboard/src/mocks/mockPolicies.ts` – Updated mock actions to use `block`/`alert` only.
- `dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` – Marked quarantine toggle as “coming soon”.
- `archive/FUTURE_TODO.md` – Captured end-to-end quarantine implementation as a tracked future enhancement.

### 14. File Transfer Blocking Feature (Windows)

#### Problem
- No protection against copying sensitive files to removable drives (USB, external SSDs)
- Files could be copied to external storage without detection or blocking
- No visual feedback in dashboard for blocked transfers
- Event details showing raw JSON instead of user-friendly information

#### Solution
- **Windows Agent Transfer Blocking:**
  - Added removable drive monitoring with `watchdog` library
  - Detects files copied to removable drives (USB, external SSDs)
  - Compares file hash (SHA256) with files in monitored directories
  - Automatically deletes copied files from removable drives when match found
  - Sends blocked transfer events with `action: "blocked"` status
  - Handles file locking issues with retry mechanism (Windows Explorer locks files during copy)
  - Configurable via `transfer_blocking.enabled` in agent config

- **Backend Event Processing:**
  - Updated `EventCreate` model to accept `action`, `destination`, `blocked`, `event_subtype`, `description`, `user_email` fields
  - Backend now properly stores agent-provided `action` field (mapped to `action_taken`)
  - Fixed hardcoded `action_taken: "logged"` to use agent-provided action
  - Added debug logging for action field tracking

- **Dashboard Event Display:**
  - Created user-friendly `EventDetailModal` component for blocked transfers
  - Visual flow display: Source → Destination with file details
  - Shows file size, hash, transfer type, and action taken
  - Expandable raw JSON section for technical details
  - Improved standard event display with better formatting
  - Fixed `action_taken` field display (now shows "blocked" for blocked transfers, "logged" for others)

#### Configuration
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "transfer_blocking": {
      "enabled": true,
      "block_removable_drives": true,
      "poll_interval_seconds": 5
    }
  }
}
```

#### Files Changed
- `agents/endpoint/windows/agent.py` - Added transfer blocking logic, removable drive monitoring, file hash comparison
- `agents/endpoint/windows/agent_config.json` - Added transfer_blocking configuration section
- `server/app/api/v1/events.py` - Updated EventCreate model and event processing
- `dashboard/src/pages/Events.tsx` - Added EventDetailModal component and improved event display
- `dashboard/src/app/dashboard/events/page.tsx` - Added EventDetailModal component (app router version)

#### Testing Results
- ✅ Transfer blocking detects files copied to USB drives
- ✅ Files successfully deleted from removable drives when match found
- ✅ Blocked transfer events show `action_taken: "blocked"` in dashboard
- ✅ User-friendly event modal displays transfer details correctly
- ✅ File locking issues handled with retry mechanism
- ✅ Works with multiple monitored directories
- ✅ Handles path normalization (E:file.txt → E:\file.txt)

### 12. Agent Lifecycle Management and Heartbeat Improvements

#### Problem
- Agents didn't unregister cleanly on shutdown, leaving stale entries in dashboard
- Heartbeat timeout errors (5s timeout too short)
- Rate limiting middleware blocking agent heartbeats
- Agent names using hostname instead of friendly names
- "Last seen" timestamps not updating correctly
- Dashboard showing dead/inactive agents

#### Solution
- **Graceful Agent Shutdown:**
  - Added `unregister_agent()` method to both Linux and Windows agents
  - Agents now call `/agents/{agent_id}/unregister` endpoint on shutdown
  - Added signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) for clean shutdown
  - Added `atexit` handler as backup for cleanup

- **Heartbeat System Improvements:**
  - Increased heartbeat timeout from 5s to 30s (handles slow server responses)
  - Reduced heartbeat interval from 60s to 30s (more frequent updates)
  - Heartbeat now sends timestamp (ISO format with Z suffix) and IP address
  - Improved heartbeat logging (INFO level instead of DEBUG)
  - Fixed datetime timezone awareness in heartbeat endpoint

- **Rate Limiting Fix:**
  - Bypassed rate limiting for agent endpoints (heartbeat, registration)
  - Prevents Redis delays from blocking critical agent operations
  - Fixed datetime timezone comparison errors in rate limiting

- **Agent Name Standardization:**
  - Linux agent default name: "Linux-Agent" (was hostname)
  - Windows agent default name: "Windows-Agent" (configurable)
  - Updated config files with new default names

- **Backend Agent Management:**
  - Agents filtered by `last_seen` timestamp (only active within 5 minutes)
  - Dead agents automatically cleaned up in background
  - Removed `status` field (replaced with time-based filtering)
  - Backend converts datetime to ISO strings with 'Z' suffix for frontend

- **Frontend Improvements:**
  - Dashboard shows only active agents (filtered by backend)
  - Removed status indicators (no longer needed)
  - "Last seen" displays correctly with IST timezone
  - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds for real-time updates
  - Events page shows agent names instead of agent IDs

### 13. Timezone Display Fixes (IST)

#### Problem
- Dashboard timestamps displayed in UTC instead of IST
- Timezone conversion not working correctly
- "Last seen" times showing incorrect values

#### Solution
- **Frontend Timezone Conversion:**
  - Added `parseAsUTC()` function to handle dates without timezone info
  - All date formatting functions now use IST timezone (`Asia/Kolkata`)
  - Updated `formatDate()`, `formatRelativeTime()`, `formatTimeIST()`, `formatDateTimeIST()`
  - Fixed UTC date parsing (appends 'Z' if timezone missing)

- **Backend Timestamp Formatting:**
  - Backend explicitly converts datetime objects to ISO strings with 'Z' suffix
  - Ensures frontend receives properly formatted UTC timestamps
  - Fixed timezone awareness in heartbeat endpoint

- **Dashboard Components Updated:**
  - Events page: All timestamps display in IST
  - Agents page: "Last seen" and "Registered" times in IST
  - Dashboard charts: X-axis and tooltips show IST times
  - Recent events: Timestamps in IST format

- SSL connection errors
- Healthcheck authentication failures

#### Solution
- **`server/app/core/opensearch.py`**: Fixed client initialization
  - Conditionally add `http_auth` only if `OPENSEARCH_USE_SSL` is `True`
  - Fixed `exists_index_template` check using `get_index_template` with `NotFoundError` handling
  - Removed unnecessary `connection_class` parameter
  - Added error handling in `close_opensearch()`

- **`server/app/core/config.py`**: Updated OpenSearch settings
  - Set `OPENSEARCH_USE_SSL: bool = Field(default=False)`

#### Files Changed
- `server/app/core/opensearch.py`
- `server/app/core/config.py`

---

### 8. Frontend API Client Updates

#### Problem
- API client using wrong port (8000 instead of 55000)
- Environment variables not properly read (Next.js vs Vite)
- Missing exports for API functions

#### Solution
- **`dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`**: Multiple fixes
  - Updated `baseURL` to use `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` (Vite format)
  - Changed default port from 8000 to 55000
  - Fixed refresh token endpoint to use correct API URL
  - Exported all required functions: `getStats`, `getEventTimeSeries`, `getEventsByType`, `getEventsBySeverity`, `getAgents`, `deleteAgent`, `getAlerts`, `searchEvents`
  - Exported `Agent` and `Event` types
  - Fixed `getEventTimeSeries` function signature

#### Files Changed
- `dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`

---

### 9. Dashboard Overview Page Fix

#### Problem
- Dashboard overview page showing all zeros (0 agents, 0 events)
- Stats cards not displaying real data from database
- Charts not showing any data
- Dashboard data not synchronized with Agents and Events pages

#### Solution
- **`server/app/api/v1/dashboard.py`**: Fixed dashboard overview endpoint
  - Changed events collection from `db["events"]` to `db.dlp_events` (correct collection name)
  - Added agent queries from MongoDB `agents` collection
  - Updated response format to match frontend expectations:
    - `total_agents`: Count of all registered agents
    - `active_agents`: Count of agents with status "online"
    - `total_events`: Total count of all events
    - `critical_alerts`: Count of events with severity "critical"
    - `blocked_events`: Count of blocked events

- **`server/app/api/v1/events.py`**: Added missing stats endpoints
  - Added `/events/stats/by-type` endpoint for pie chart data
  - Added `/events/stats/by-severity` endpoint for bar chart data
  - Both endpoints aggregate data from `dlp_events` collection
  - Return data in format expected by chart components

- **`server/app/api/v1/dashboard.py`**: Fixed timeline endpoint
  - Updated to use `db.dlp_events` collection
  - Returns timeline data in correct format for line chart

#### Files Changed
- `server/app/api/v1/dashboard.py`
- `server/app/api/v1/events.py`

#### Testing
- Verified dashboard shows correct agent count (3 agents)
- Verified dashboard shows correct event count (362 events)
- Verified charts display data correctly:
  - Events Over Time: Line chart with hourly event counts
  - Events by Type: Pie chart showing file (99%), clipboard (1%)
  - Events by Severity: Bar chart showing critical, high, medium, low
- Verified data consistency across Dashboard, Agents, and Events pages

---

### 10. Alerts Page Fix

#### Problem
- Alerts page showing "0 alerts" even though dashboard showed 33 critical alerts
- Alerts API endpoint returning empty array
- `AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'get'` when accessing current_user

#### Solution
- **`server/app/api/v1/alerts.py`**: Complete rewrite of alerts endpoint
  - Generates alerts dynamically from critical/high severity events in MongoDB
  - Checks for existing alerts in MongoDB collection first
  - If no alerts exist, creates alerts from events with severity "critical" or "high"
  - Formats alert titles and descriptions based on event type:
    - File events: "Sensitive Data Detected in File" with file path
    - Clipboard events: "Sensitive Data Copied to Clipboard"
    - USB events: "USB Device Connected"
  - Sets all generated alerts to status "new"
  - Added optional filtering by severity and status
  - Fixed `current_user` access: Changed `current_user.get("email")` to `getattr(current_user, "email", "unknown")`

#### Files Changed
- `server/app/api/v1/alerts.py`

#### Testing
- Verified alerts page displays 33 new alerts (matching dashboard critical alerts count)
- Verified stats cards show correct counts (33 New, 0 Acknowledged, 0 Resolved)
- Verified alerts list displays:
  - Severity badges (critical)
  - Alert titles and descriptions
  - File paths for file events
  - Agent IDs
  - Timestamps
  - Event IDs
  - Acknowledge/Resolve buttons
- Verified alerts are generated from critical/high severity events

### 12. Windows Agent USB Monitoring Threading Fix

#### Problem
- Windows agent throwing `wmi.x_wmi_uninitialised_thread` error
- USB monitoring failing with COM initialization error
- Error message: "WMI returned a syntax error: you're probably running inside a thread without first calling pythoncom.CoInitialize[Ex]"

#### Solution
- **`agents/endpoint/windows/agent.py`**: Fixed COM initialization in USB monitoring thread
  - Changed from `pythoncom.CoInitialize()` to `pythoncom.CoInitializeEx(pythoncom.COINIT_MULTITHREADED)` for better thread safety
  - Added fallback to `CoInitialize()` if `CoInitializeEx` is not available
  - Improved error handling with `exc_info=True` for better debugging
  - Added try/except around `CoUninitialize()` to prevent cleanup errors
  - USB monitoring now properly initializes COM in the separate thread

#### Files Changed
- `agents/endpoint/windows/agent.py`

#### Testing Results
- ✅ USB monitoring starts without errors
- ✅ No more `x_wmi_uninitialised_thread` exceptions
- ✅ USB device detection working correctly
- ✅ Windows agent runs cleanly without threading errors

---

### 11. Agents Page Display Fix

#### Problem
- Agents page showing white screen
- `RangeError: Invalid time value` in console
- Outdated Agent type definition

#### Solution
- **`dashboard/src/pages/Agents.tsx`**: Updated field names
  - Changed `agent.registered_at` to `agent.created_at`
  - Updated to use `agent.last_seen` instead of `agent.last_heartbeat`

- **`dashboard/src/lib/utils.ts`**: Improved date handling
  - Added null/undefined checks in `formatRelativeTime`
  - Added try-catch for invalid dates
  - Returns "Never" for null/undefined dates

- **`dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`**: Updated Agent type
  - Changed `last_heartbeat` to `last_seen`
  - Added `created_at` field
  - Updated field types to match API response

#### Files Changed
- `dashboard/src/pages/Agents.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/lib/utils.ts`
- `dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`

2. **Agent-Side Policy Enforcement**: Not implemented - all events sent with `"action": "logged"`
3. **WSL IP**: Currently hardcoded - should use dynamic detection or environment variable
4. **Default Password**: Should be changed in production
