## 📦 GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow automatically:
1. Triggers on push to `main` branch or tags
2. Builds Docker images for both services
3. Pushes to GitHub Container Registry
4. Supports multi-platform (amd64, arm64)
5. Uses layer caching for fast builds

**Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/build-images.yml`

### First-Time Trigger

The workflow will run automatically on the next push or you can manually trigger it:

1. Go to: https://github.com/cybersentinel-06/Data-Loss-Prevention/actions
2. Click on "Build and Push Docker Images"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Monitor Build Progress

1. Go to: https://github.com/cybersentinel-06/Data-Loss-Prevention/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Watch the build progress
4. Images will be pushed to GHCR when complete

---

## 🔐 GHCR Images

Once the workflow completes, images will be available at:

```
ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06/dlp-manager:latest
ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06/dlp-dashboard:latest
```

### Image Tags

The workflow creates these tags:
- `latest` — Latest build from main branch
- `main` — Same as latest
- `v1.0.0` — Semantic version (if tagged)
- `1.0` — Major.minor version (if tagged)

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Trigger First Build

Go to GitHub Actions and manually trigger the workflow to build the first images:
https://github.com/cybersentinel-06/Data-Loss-Prevention/actions

### 2. Wait for Build (5-10 minutes)

The workflow will:
- Build manager image (Python + FastAPI)
- Build dashboard image (React + Nginx)
- Push both to GHCR
- Tag as `latest`

### 3. Test Installation

After images are built, test the one-liner installation:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybersentinel-06/Data-Loss-Prevention/main/install.sh)
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check services
docker compose ps

# Test API
curl http://localhost:55000/api/v1/health

# Open dashboard
# http://localhost:4000
```

---

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### Check GitHub Actions
1. Visit: https://github.com/cybersentinel-06/Data-Loss-Prevention/actions
2. Ensure workflow ran successfully
3. Check both images were built

### Check GHCR Packages
1. Visit: https://github.com/cybersentinel-06?tab=packages
2. Look for:
   - `dlp-manager`
   - `dlp-dashboard`
3. Verify "latest" tag exists

### Test Image Pull
```bash
# Test pulling images
docker pull ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06/dlp-manager:latest
docker pull ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06/dlp-dashboard:latest

# Verify images exist
docker images | grep ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06
```

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Update Images

When you push new code, GitHub Actions automatically builds new images:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: New feature"
git push origin main
# Images automatically rebuild
```

### Update Deployments

Users can update to latest images with:

```bash
cd ~/cybersentinel-dlp
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Version Releases

Create a new release to tag a version:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
# Creates ghcr.io/cybersentinel-06/dlp-manager:v1.0.0
```
