# CyberSentinel DLP - Step-by-Step Testing Guide

**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Manual testing of committed code from scratch

> **Doc map:** Pair this runbook with `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` for setup. Anything not explicitly covered lives in `archive/docs/` as historical reference.

---

## Prerequisites Check

### 1. Verify Docker is Running
```bash
docker ps
# Should show running containers or empty list
```

### 2. Verify Python is Installed (for agents)
```bash
python3 --version
# Should show Python 3.9 or higher
```

### 3. Check Required Ports
```bash
# Check if ports are available
netstat -tuln | grep -E "3000|55000|5432|27017|6379|9200"
# Or use: ss -tuln | grep -E "3000|55000|5432|27017|6379|9200"
```

---

## Step 1: Start Docker Services

### 1.1 Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd /home/vansh/Code/Data-Loss-Prevention
```

### 1.2 Start Database Services First
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres mongodb redis opensearch
```

### 1.3 Wait for Services to be Healthy (30 seconds)
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# Wait until all show "healthy" or "Up"
# You can also check logs:
docker-compose logs postgres | tail -10
docker-compose logs mongodb | tail -10
```

### 1.4 Initialize Database
```bash
docker-compose run --rm manager python init_db.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Users table created
✓ Policies table created
✓ Default admin user created
Database initialization complete!
```

### 1.5 Build and Start All Services
```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

**Expected:** All services should show "Up" or "Healthy"

---

## Step 2: Verify Dashboard is Running

### 2.1 Check Dashboard Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs dashboard | tail -20
```

### 2.2 Check Manager/API Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs manager | tail -20
```

### 2.3 Test API Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:55000/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","service":"CyberSentinel DLP","version":"2.0.0"}
```

### 2.4 Access Dashboard in Browser
```bash
# Open in browser:
http://localhost:3000
```

**Login credentials:**
- **Email:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`

---

## Step 3: Test Dashboard Functionality

### 3.1 Login Test
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in browser
2. You should see login page
3. Enter credentials: `admin` / `admin`
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Should redirect to dashboard

### 3.2 Dashboard Overview Verification
1. After login, verify dashboard loads without errors and cards populate. The exact counts depend on current DB state (e.g., during final QA we expect **Total Agents = 2**, **Active Agents = 2**, **Total Events ≈ 100+**, **Critical Alerts ≥ recent violations**). The key check is that numbers render and update as events/agents come online.
2. Charts (Events Over Time / by Type / by Severity / DLP Actions) should render with whatever live data exists. If you initialized a brand-new database they will start at zero.

### 3.3 Navigate to Agents Page
1. Click "Agents" in sidebar
2. After the agents (Step 4/5) register you should see both Linux and Windows entries with live `last_seen`, IPs, and policy sync metadata.

### 3.4 Navigate to Events Page
1. Click "Events" in sidebar
2. If you have not generated events yet it will say “0 events found”. With existing data, use `*` in the search bar and hit **Search** to list all records.
3. Confirm the table renders and that clicking a row shows the right-hand drawer with policy match details.

### 3.5 Backend API Smoke Tests
Run these from another terminal (still inside the repo root) after services are up:

```bash
# 1) Obtain token (capture JSON)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin"

# Convenience: store token in ENV for the shell session
export TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin" | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# 2) Policy listing + stats
curl -i http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -i http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/stats/summary -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 3) CRUD smoke (creates temporary policy, updates it, toggles, then deletes)
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"CLI QA Policy","description":"temporary","priority":80,"type":"clipboard_monitoring","severity":"medium","enabled":true,"config":{"patterns":{"predefined":["email"],"custom":[]},"action":"alert"}}'

# Replace POLICY_ID with the ID returned above
curl -i -X PUT http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/POLICY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"CLI QA Policy","description":"updated","priority":70,"type":"clipboard_monitoring","severity":"high","enabled":false,"config":{"patterns":{"predefined":["email","api_key"],"custom":[]},"action":"alert"}}'

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/POLICY_ID/enable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/POLICY_ID/disable \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:55000/api/v1/policies/POLICY_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# 4) Event ingestion smoke
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/events/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_id":"qa-cli-001","agent_id":"cli-agent","agent_name":"CLI Agent","agent_type":"linux","agent_version":"1.0.0","event_type":"file","event_subtype":"file_created","severity":"medium","file_path":"/home/vansh/Code/Data-Loss-Prevention/tmp_linux_policy/final_ssn.txt","file_extension":".txt","content":"SSN: 123-45-6789","timestamp":"'"$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")"'"}'

curl -i "http://localhost:55000/api/v1/events/?limit=5" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

These steps confirm the policy transformer, stats endpoint, EventProcessor, and Mongo persistence are healthy before moving on to agent tests.

---

## Step 9: Final Verification

### 9.1 Dashboard Data Consistency Check
1. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - Total Agents = 2
   - Active Agents = 2
   - Total Events = Sum of all events
   - Critical Alerts = Count of critical/high events

2. **Agents Page:**
   - Shows 2 agents (Linux + Windows)
   - Both showing "online" status
   - Recent "Last Seen" timestamps

3. **Events Page:**
   - Shows events from both agents
   - Can filter by agent_id
   - Events have correct severity and types

4. **Alerts Page:**
   - Shows alerts generated from critical/high events
   - Alert count matches dashboard "Critical Alerts"

### 9.2 API Verification (Optional)
```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin" | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# Test agents endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:55000/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool | head -30

# Test events endpoint
curl -s "http://localhost:55000/api/v1/events?limit=5" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

## Step 10: Test Google Drive Integration

### 10.1 Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Platform project with Google Drive API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 credentials configured (see `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`)
- Environment variables set in `.env`:
  ```bash
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
  GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:55000/api/v1/google-drive/callback
  ```

### 10.2 Create Google Drive Policy
1. Open dashboard: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to **Policies** page
3. Click **"Create Policy"**
4. Select **"Google Drive Cloud"** policy type
5. Click **"Connect Google Drive"** button
6. Complete OAuth flow:
   - Authorize CyberSentinel to access Google Drive
   - Select folders to protect (e.g., "My Drive/Projects/test_files")
   - Confirm folder selection
7. Configure policy:
   - Name: "Test Google Drive Policy"
   - Description: "Monitor test_files folder"
   - Severity: High
   - Priority: 80
   - Enabled: Yes
8. Review and save policy

### 10.3 Verify Protected Folders
1. In policy form, verify:
   - Connection shows "Connected" status
   - Protected folders list shows selected folders
   - "Monitoring since" date is displayed (should be current time)
2. Check individual folder baselines:
   - Each folder should show baseline timestamp
   - Baseline should be set to when folder was added

### 10.4 Test Google Drive Polling

**Option A: Wait for Automatic Polling**
- Polling runs every 5 minutes (configured in Celery Beat)
- Wait up to 5 minutes for next scheduled run

**Option B: Trigger Manual Poll**
1. Go to **Events** page
2. Click **"Manual Refresh"** button
3. Wait a few seconds for poll to complete
4. Check Events page for new Google Drive events

### 10.5 Create Test Activity in Google Drive
1. Go to your Google Drive
2. Navigate to protected folder (e.g., "My Drive/Projects/test_files")
3. Create a new file: `test_dlp_monitoring.txt`
4. Add some content (optionally with PII to test policy matching)
5. Save the file

### 10.6 Verify Events in Dashboard
1. Go to **Events** page
2. Click **"Manual Refresh"** (or wait for automatic poll)
3. Look for new Google Drive event:
   - **Source:** `google_drive_cloud`
   - **Event Type:** `file`
   - **Event Subtype:** `file_created`
   - **File Path:** `My Drive/Projects/test_files`
   - **File Name:** `test_dlp_monitoring.txt`
   - **Agent ID:** `gdrive-{connection_id}`
   - **Timestamp:** Should show actual Google Drive activity time (not poll time)

### 10.7 Test Additional File Operations
1. **Modify file:**
   - Edit `test_dlp_monitoring.txt` in Google Drive
   - Trigger manual refresh
   - Verify `file_modified` event appears

2. **Delete file:**
   - Delete `test_dlp_monitoring.txt` in Google Drive
   - Trigger manual refresh
   - Verify `file_deleted` event appears

### 10.8 Test Baseline Reset
1. Go to **Policies** page
2. Edit Google Drive Cloud policy
3. Click **"Reset Connection Baseline"** button
4. Verify baseline timestamp updates to current time
5. Create a new file in protected folder
6. Trigger manual refresh
7. Verify only new file event appears (not historical events)

### 10.9 Verify No Duplicate Events
1. Trigger manual refresh multiple times (without creating new files)
2. Verify no duplicate events appear
3. Each event should have unique ID
4. Event count should remain stable

### 10.10 API Verification (Optional)
```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin&password=admin" | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# List Google Drive connections
curl -s http://localhost:55000/api/v1/google-drive/connections \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

# Get protected folders for a connection
CONNECTION_ID="your-connection-id"
curl -s "http://localhost:55000/api/v1/google-drive/connections/$CONNECTION_ID/protected-folders" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

# Trigger manual poll
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:55000/api/v1/google-drive/poll \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool

# Get Google Drive events
curl -s "http://localhost:55000/api/v1/events?limit=10&source=google_drive_cloud" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### 10.11 Check Celery Logs
```bash
# Check Celery Beat (scheduler)
docker-compose logs celery-beat | grep -i "google\|drive"

# Check Celery Worker (polling execution)
docker-compose logs celery-worker | grep -i "google\|drive\|poll"

# Check for errors
docker-compose logs celery-worker | grep -i error
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ OAuth flow completes successfully
- ✅ Protected folders are stored in database
- ✅ Polling service fetches new activities
- ✅ Events appear in dashboard with correct metadata
- ✅ Event timestamps use actual Google Drive activity time
- ✅ Baseline prevents historical event re-ingestion
- ✅ Manual refresh triggers immediate polling
- ✅ No duplicate events appear
- ✅ Policy matching works for Google Drive events

---

## Step 11: Cleanup (After Testing)

### 11.1 Stop Agents
```bash
# Linux agent: Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running agent.py
# Windows agent: Press Ctrl+C in PowerShell window
```

### 11.2 Stop Docker Services
```bash
cd /home/vansh/Code/Data-Loss-Prevention
docker-compose down
```

### 11.3 Verify Everything Stopped
```bash
# Check Docker containers
docker ps

# Check agent processes
ps aux | grep agent.py | grep -v grep
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading
- Check: `docker-compose logs dashboard`
- Verify port 3000 is not in use: `netstat -tuln | grep 3000`

### Agent Not Connecting
- Check: `docker-compose logs manager | grep -i error`
- Verify server URL in agent config
- Test: `curl http://localhost:55000/health`
