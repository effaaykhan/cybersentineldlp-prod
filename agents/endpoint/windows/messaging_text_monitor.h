// Typed-message DLP for desktop messaging apps — CyberSentinel DLP Windows Agent
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES
// -------------------
// Messaging App Attachment Control watches the file picker: it sees a file
// chosen through the app's Open dialog and can block it. It never sees the far
// more common case — somebody TYPING sensitive data straight into the chat box.
// An operator who switched that policy to Block reasonably believed sensitive
// data could no longer leave over WhatsApp. It could, and did: a pasted or typed
// Aadhaar number went out with nothing logged, because no file dialog ever
// opened and so no code path ran at all.
//
// This module covers the typed path, in two modes.
//
// BLOCK MODE — hold, inspect, then release
// ----------------------------------------
// A low-level keyboard hook (WH_KEYBOARD_LL — no DLL injection, no code inside
// the target app) watches for the send gesture: Enter, or Ctrl+Enter, in a
// window owned by a managed messaging app. The keystroke is swallowed and a
// worker thread:
//
//   1. reads the composer text through UI Automation,
//   2. classifies it with the agent's local classifier (regex + Luhn,
//      sub-millisecond — no server round trip, works offline),
//   3. re-injects the keystroke if the message is clean, or drops it and
//      raises an event if it is not.
//
// The hold is typically 10-100ms and imperceptible in a chat window.
//
// ALERT MODE — sample, and never touch input
// ------------------------------------------
// Alert mode does not hold anything, so it cannot read the composer at send
// time: by the time the worker looks, the app has cleared the box. It therefore
// keeps a light sampler on the focused composer while a managed app is in the
// foreground, and on Enter classifies the most recent snapshot.
//
// That is exactly the sampling gap the block path refuses (see below), and it
// is accepted here because the two modes are answering different questions.
// Block mode is asked to GUARANTEE that nothing sensitive leaves, and a
// guarantee with a 500ms hole in it is not one. Alert mode is asked to tell an
// operator what their fleet is doing before they turn enforcement on, and a
// sampler answers that honestly. What alert mode must never do is silently
// record NOTHING, which is what it did before this: the hook returned early
// unless the action was Block, so an operator auditing first saw an empty
// dashboard and concluded the channel was quiet.
//
// WHY HOLD-AND-RELEASE, AND NOT THE SCREENSHOT MODULE'S PRECOMPUTED FLAG
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// ScreenCaptureMonitor keeps a background thread scoring the screen and has the
// hook read one atomic bool, because OCR is far too slow to run inside a hook
// and a screenshot cannot be meaningfully "replayed" later.
//
// Neither constraint applies here. Classifying a chat message is a regex sweep,
// and an Enter key CAN be replayed — perfectly, a few milliseconds later, with
// SendInput. Holding it means the verdict is computed against the text that is
// actually in the box at the moment of sending, instead of whatever a sampler
// last happened to see. A sampled flag would leave a real hole: type or paste a
// number and hit Enter inside the sampling gap and it ships uninspected. That
// hole is the entire bug this module exists to close, so it is not reintroduced
// as an implementation detail on the path that promises to close it.
//
// FINDING THE APP, AND FINDING THE BOX
// ------------------------------------
// Two things that look like implementation detail decide whether this module
// does anything at all, and both were wrong in the first cut:
//
//   * A packaged (MSIX/UWP) app such as the Store build of WhatsApp does not
//     own its own top-level window. The foreground HWND is an
//     ApplicationFrameWindow belonging to ApplicationFrameHost.exe, and the app
//     itself owns a child CoreWindow. Resolving the process from the foreground
//     window alone therefore yields "applicationframehost.exe", which is in no
//     managed-app list, so the hook passes every keystroke through and the
//     feature silently does nothing. We step through the frame host to the
//     child window's process.
//
//   * The composer must be located by FOCUS, never by size. Current WhatsApp
//     builds for Windows are a WebView2/Chromium wrapper, where the entire
//     conversation is one Document node — so "take the longest Edit/Document in
//     the window", which is safe in a native XAML app, picks the chat HISTORY.
//     That blocks every send on something said last month and ships the whole
//     conversation off the endpoint as evidence. Everything here is scoped to
//     the focused element and its subtree; the window-wide sweep survives only
//     as a last resort, restricted to editable nodes and size-capped.
//
// SAFETY RULES, and they matter more than coverage here
// -----------------------------------------------------
//   * ALERT mode never touches input. Keystrokes are only ever held when an
//     admin has explicitly chosen Block, so the audit-first rollout the rest of
//     the product follows costs the user nothing.
//   * Every failure path RELEASES the keystroke, including the one where the
//     inspection never finishes: a watchdog releases anything held longer than
//     decisionTimeoutMs. Without it a wedged UI Automation call — and Chromium
//     enabling its accessibility tree on first query is exactly that call —
//     holds the Enter forever AND keeps swallowing the matching key-ups, so the
//     key reads as stuck down inside the app. A DLP agent that appears to break
//     the keyboard gets uninstalled.
//   * Injected keystrokes are ignored (LLKHF_INJECTED), so our own replay
//     cannot re-enter the hook and loop.
//   * The hook holds no locks and does no I/O — it flips an atomic and signals
//     a worker, so it can never approach the LowLevelHooksTimeout that would
//     make Windows silently evict it.
//   * Exactly one of {worker, watchdog} resolves any given keystroke, decided
//     by an atomic claim. Both releasing would send the message twice.
//
// SCOPE — what this does NOT cover
//   * Sending by CLICKING the send button. Deciding whether a click lands on
//     that button needs a UI Automation hit-test, which cannot run inside a
//     mouse hook, and swallowing clicks globally to find out is not a risk
//     worth taking for the minority gesture.
//   * Apps that send on a key this doesn't know about.
//   * Text pasted and sent inside one sampling-free instant is still caught in
//     BLOCK mode, because the text is read at send time — but the paste itself
//     is Clipboard control's job and remains so.
