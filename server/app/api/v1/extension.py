"""
Browser-extension distribution — the update feed endpoints force-install from.

Chrome and Edge fetch ``update.xml`` and the ``.crx`` themselves, as the browser
process, with no credentials and no session. So these three routes are:

  * UNAUTHENTICATED — the browser has nothing to authenticate with. What they
    serve is a signed, publicly-distributable extension package, not data.
  * EXEMPT from the portal IP allowlist — an endpoint must keep receiving
    extension updates from any network, exactly like the agent endpoints.
  * served with the exact content types the browsers require. Chrome refuses a
    CRX served as text/plain, and the failure is silent from the endpoint's side.

Content is produced by ``scripts/pack-extension.py`` into ``server/extension_dist``.
When that directory is empty every route 404s with a message saying so, which is
the honest answer to "nothing has been packed yet" and far easier to diagnose
than an empty feed that looks like it worked.
