"""
JWKS retrieval and key selection for asymmetric SSO exchange tokens.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The SSO exchange token used to be signed HS256 with ``DLP_SSO_SECRET`` — a
secret shared with the SIEM. That means the DLP holds a key that can FORGE
SIEM tokens, not merely verify them, and with just-in-time provisioning
enabled a forged token does not just impersonate an existing user: it mints a
DLP account at whatever role the forger writes into the claims.

Under RS256 the DLP holds only the SIEM's PUBLIC key. A compromise of the DLP
config yields nothing that can sign anything, and the SIEM can rotate keys
without a coordinated flag day because each token names the key that signs it
in its ``kid`` header.

CACHE AND ROTATION
------------------
The key set is cached for ``SSO_JWKS_CACHE_SECONDS``. A token whose ``kid`` is
not in the cached set triggers ONE early refetch, rate-limited so an attacker
cannot turn unknown-kid tokens into a request amplifier against the SIEM. That
is what makes a rotation visible within seconds instead of at the end of the
cache window, without polling.

FAILURE POSTURE — CLOSED
------------------------
Every other cache in this codebase fails OPEN, because failing closed there
turns a dependency blip into an outage of a monitoring feature. This one is
different: it is an authentication decision, and a key set we could not fetch
is not evidence that a signature is good. Unreachable JWKS ⇒ the login is
refused, never accepted unverified.
