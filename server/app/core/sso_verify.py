"""
Signature and claim verification for SIEM SSO exchange tokens.

ALGORITHM ROUTING
-----------------
The token's own signed ``alg`` header selects how it is verified:

    RS*/PS*/ES*  ->  the SIEM's public key, fetched from SIEM_JWKS_URL and
                     selected by ``kid`` (app/core/sso_jwks.py)
    HS*          ->  the shared secret DLP_SSO_SECRET

Routing on the header is safe here only because the two paths use disjoint key
material: the classic downgrade attack — take the published RSA public key,
sign HS256 with it as the "secret" — fails because the HS256 path never uses a
key derived from the JWKS. It uses a secret the attacker does not have.

The list passed to the verifier is always the single routed algorithm, never
the union, so a token cannot nominate a verifier that was not intended for it,
and ``none`` is unreachable by construction.

Retiring HS256 is deliberately a config action, not a code change: clear
DLP_SSO_SECRET and every symmetric token is refused from that moment. Keeping
both configured is the migration window, and is the SIEM's call to close.

AUDIENCE
--------
``aud`` is enforced strictly on the asymmetric path — that is the new contract
and both sides agreed it. On the symmetric path it is enforced only when the
token actually carries the claim, because a SIEM build that predates the
contract sends no ``aud`` and must not be locked out by a DLP upgrade. Such a
build starts being checked the instant it starts sending one; there is no
switch to remember to flip.

CLOCK
-----
The exchange token lives ~30 seconds. Two machines a minute apart therefore
reject every login, with nothing in either log that names the clock as the
cause. ``SSO_CLOCK_LEEWAY_SECONDS`` absorbs that, and ``SSO_REQUIRE_EXP``
closes the other side of it: python-jose does not require ``exp`` at all by
default, so a token that simply omits it would otherwise never expire.
